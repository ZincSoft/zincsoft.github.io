                Catnet is similar to TOR in that it is a way to route around censorship and access
                blocked content. However, Catnet is much more efficient and can handle much larger
                loads than TOR. It is also designed to be more scalable, allowing it to handle more
                users and traffic. Both Catnet and TOR place a strong emphasis on anonymity and
                security. Catnet is designed to be more efficient than traditional networks. However,
                TOR is (at least partially) centralized in that it uses a Directory Authority, which
                can be corrupted, taken over by the government, etc... By contrast, Catnet uses a DHT
                to distribute information and eliminate the need for a central authority This makes
                it more scalable and allows it to handle more users and traffic. Catnet is also
                designed to be more secure than traditional networks, using mandatory cryptography
                to protect information.

                <h3 class="font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl pt-2">and why it's better.</h3>
                <p class="pt-8 text-xl lg:text-justify tracking-wide">
                Catnet is fundamentally different from almost every Web3 system. It swaps out one of
                the very basic pillars of its operation, the blockchain, with an on-demand informational
                processing system. Unlike the fundamental immutability of the blockchain, the state on
                the network can be mutated and wiped as needed. This makes it possible to create truly
                dynamic systems that can communicate with each other and change their behaviour as needed
                (this can include software updates, or even kill themselves). This degree of flexibility
                is unavailable in any other system. Catnet does not implement any De-Fi protocols into
                it's core, because of our pledge to simplicity and focus. If anything, any De-Fi system
                would take place on the application layer (OSI). Catnet is not a blockchain, so it cannot
                be used to create tokens or cryptocurrencies. However, it can still be used to create a
                token or cryptocurrency system on the application layer. Catnet is a proposed replacement
                for the network layer and above in a Web3 system. It is designed to be more efficient and
                scalable than traditional networks. Unlike preexisting Web3 systems and network overlays
                (TOR), Catnet replaces the IP protocol itself, leading to more opportunities for anonymity
                (see Alias Routing).

                <h3 class="font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl pt-2">and how to make it efficient.</h3>
                <p class="pt-8 text-xl lg:text-justify tracking-wide">
                The syncing of information is critical to some Catnet protocols. In order to facilitate a
                single interface to control the synchronization of data that are compatible with protocols
                across all (applicable) OSI levels. The synchronization header uses the Header Hierarchy
                System, to provide the flexibility required to contain many different data formats, without
                having to reimplement the protocols or at least a subset of them. As synchronization occurs,
                it spreads throughout the network (looking at DHTs), killed with a TTL value. After traversal,
                the message is propagated back to the origin, and participants in the process may choose to
                ignore or accept this information to build their own cache (if reasonable). This way, less
                synchronization is needed, as it becomes more and more likely that a synchronization request
                isn't required.

                <h3 class="font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl pt-2">and how it helps DRY.</h3>
                <p class="pt-8 text-xl lg:text-justify tracking-wide">
                Deviating from the internet protocols, the Catnet protocols try to reduce the number of
                protocols instead of following the DRY principle more closely. Take UDP and TCP as an 
                example. They both have duplicated fields and can share code, not to mention perform the
                same basic task. The Header Hierarchy System (HHS) specifies complimentary headers and how
                they are integrated. This system is designed to make it possible to have a single header
                that can encapsulate different payloads, as well as multiplex different protocols over a
                single connection. This system also allows for the easy addition of new protocols, without
                the need to update the entire system. This helps to reduce code repetition, creating a more
                maintainable code base, along with simplifying the protocols underlying Catnet.

                <h3 class="font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl pt-2">and how they work in Catnet.</h3>
                <p class="pt-8 text-xl lg:text-justify tracking-wide">
                DHTs are a key part of Catnet and are used to distribute information across the network.
                In a DHT, each node is responsible for a portion of the overall data. This data is distributed
                across the network and can be accessed by any node. A DHT is a sort of cache; it's populated
                on the fly and information is offloaded when not needed. When a node wants to access data,
                it queries its own DHT instance for the relevant nodes. If no relevant nodes are found the
                nature of this system allows for the traversal of other nodes, querying their DHT instances until
                all the information is found. The DHTs contain metadata that allows for tracking other nodes that may
                have the information. One of the key benefits of a DHT is that it allows for the efficient distribution
                of information. This distribution is done on the fly, meaning that information is only distributed when
                it is needed. This helps to reduce the load on the network and allows for more efficient use of
                resources. Additionally, because DHTs are just caches that would have to be tracked locally by malware,
                any "successful" attack, would only map the network, which can be done completely legally.

                <h3 class="font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl pt-2">and how controlled spoofing can be used for good.</h3>
                <p class="pt-8 text-xl lg:text-justify tracking-wide">
                Alias routing is basically a smarter version of onion routing (vast simplification). It leverages the
                power of the CP protocol to do a controlled spoof. The CP only allows for this kind of spoofing (and not)
                just in the protocol, but it also makes it impossible. Alias routing works by establishing one middleman.
                Only one is used when trasmitting and receiving information. Let's say Sam wants to visit
                <a href="https://sally.com">Sally.com</a>, without making themselves known. First, Sam contacts Sally.com
                directly. Instead of passing an CP to send the message back to the origin, Sam sends the CP of the middleman,
                also called an alias. Sam also sends an alias token. Sally.com sends their request to the alias, along with
                the alias token. Before all this happened, Sam made a deal with the alias, and registeres an alias token with
                a specific CP. Whenever the alias receives a message from Sally.com's CP and the alias token matches up, it
                forwards it to the origin. The alias cannot see the message because of the existing TLS connection. Plus, the
                alias is switched up every once in a while so that the encryption cannot be broken in time. To show Sally.com
                that Sam is Sam after switching up the alias, a session token is checked. After a TLS connection has been established,
                Sam and Sally.com can communicate through the alias.
